Chrome web extension to summarize articles

I used the Aylien summarizing API, which summarizes a page, given its URL. Additionally I saved old articles using local storage.Whenever local storage became full, I cleared out the saved summaries and began saving them again. I integrated the API with jQuery. Additionally the Chrome web extension was formatted with HTML and CSS. 

To use:
just download the .crx file. 
Open extensions in your chrome browser. 
Turn on developer mode. 
press load unpacked extension and select the folder of unpacked files in my git hub, called unpacked. 
chrome extensions will pack and load the extension. 
try it out!
