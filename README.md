Chrome web extension to summarize articles

I used the Aylien summarizing API, which summarizes a page, given its URL. Additionally I saved old articles using local storage.Whenever local storage became full, I cleared out the saved summaries and began saving them again. I integrated the API with jQuery. Additionally the Chrome web extension was formatted with HTML and CSS.
