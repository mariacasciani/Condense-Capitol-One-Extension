Chrome web extension to summarize articles

I used the Aylien summarizing API, which summarizes a page, given its URL. Additionally I saved old articles using local storage.Whenever local storage became full, I cleared out the saved summaries and began saving them again. I integrated the API with jQuery. Additionally the Chrome web extension was formatted with HTML and CSS. 

To use:
Open extensions in your chrome browser. 
Turn on developer mode. 
Add all files BESIDES the README.md and the COex.crx file to a new folder on your desktop. 
go to the chrome web browser extensions page, and select load unpacked extension, and select the new desktop folder. 
try it out!
